# Petful Client

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

FIFO pet adoption centers mission is to ensure pets get adopted to healthy happy homes in the order that they were brought to us. We feel it is very important that no animal be without a loving home for an extended period of time. So we maintain the First in First out rule when it comes to the adoption process.
